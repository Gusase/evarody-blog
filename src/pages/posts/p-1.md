# Hi there!

This Markdown file creates a page at `your-domain.com/page-1/`

It probably isn't styled much, but Markdown does support:

- **bold** and _italics._
- lists
- [links](https://astro.build)
- and more!

I can link internally to [my conclusion](#conclusion) on the same page when writing Markdown.

## Conclusion

I can use the URL `https://example.com/page-1/#introduction` to navigate directly to my Introduction on the page.

# My First Blog Post

Published on: {new Intl.DateTimeFormat('en', {dateStyle: 'long'}).format(2022-07-01)}

Welcome to my _new blog_ about learning Astro! Here, I will share my learning journey as I build a new website.

## What I've accomplished

1. **Installing Astro**: First, I created a new Astro project and set up my online accounts.

2. **Making Pages**: I then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder.

3. **Making Blog Posts**: This is my first blog post! I now have Astro pages and Markdown posts!

## What's next

I will finish the Astro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Watch this space for more to come.

## Syntax highlighting

We also support syntax highlighting in MDX out-of-the-box! This example uses our default [Shiki theme](https://github.com/shikijs/shiki). See the [MDX integration docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/#syntax-highlighting) for configuration options.

```js

import tailwind from "@astrojs/tailwind";
import mdx from "@astrojs/mdx";
import alpinejs from "@astrojs/alpinejs";

import vercel from "@astrojs/vercel/serverless";

// https://astro.build/config
export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [
    tailwind({
      applyBaseStyles: false,
    }),
    mdx(),
    alpinejs(),
  ],
  output: "server",
  adapter: vercel(),
});
```

something **strong**, and finally a little `code()`.
